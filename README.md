# Introduction

This repo contains a collection of bots I built while playing [Screeps](https://screeps.com). They're all very incomplete or possibly broken, so if you're looking for something to load up and play with, I recommend looking elsewhereâ€¦ :D

# Bots

* ## Asimov

  This bot got me to RCL3, but one of it's several bugs got my creeps killed overnight. The patented Spaghetti&trade;-framework proved too hairy to continue with, so Asimov was shelved indefinitely. Nevertheless, many parts of Asimov still live within it's successor~~s~~. \[F\]

* ## Babbage

  T.B.A.
